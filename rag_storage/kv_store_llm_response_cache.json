If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

    "return": "This document serves as a comprehensive guide for designing maps in the **World Tank War** game, specifically focusing on a desert environment. It includes detailed descriptions of various map elements, gameplay mechanics, and design principles aimed at creating engaging strategic combat scenarios.\n\n### Key Components of the Document:\n\n1. **Map Design Guidelines**:\n   - The **Demo Map Design File** provides specific guidelines for creating maps under **Project TOG**, which is responsible for developing these design standards ([2]).\n   - The **Map Design Document**, authored by **Phucth12**, categorizes important objects used in the maps, such as Block Objects (e.g., **BO_Container**, **BO_Mountain**), Breakable Objects (e.g., **BR_Cactus**), and Hiding Objects (e.g., **HI_Grass**) ([1]).\n\n2. **Desert Environment Theme**:\n   - The desert setting, described as an arid wasteland with remnants of military bases, is central to the map's theme. Proposed names for this map include **Crimson Dunes**, **Rust Frontier**, and **Khamsin Outpost** ([2]).\n   - Specific terrain features like **quicksand**, **high ground**, and architectural details such as **rusted containers** and **mountains** are included to enhance strategic depth ([2]).\n\n3. **Gameplay Mechanics**:\n   - **Combat Zones** surrounding outposts serve as focal points for skirmishes where players vie for control.\n   - Strategic elements like **choke points** and environmental factors such as **terrain slopes** influence player strategies. For example, **flank routes** allow **Scout** tanks to create unexpected pressure, while **quicksand** near outposts forces teams to control the map carefully ([2]).\n   - **Outposts** are key locations that provide advantages such as resource control and defensive positioning. They are designed to be captured using specific tank team projectiles ([1]).\n\n4. **Grass Logic Design**:\n   - The **Grass Logic Design** document, also authored by **Phucth12**, details the functionality of **HI_Grass**, a hiding object that allows players to become invisible when inside it. This element adds tactical depth to the game by providing stealth capabilities ([3]).\n\n5. **Technical Notes**:\n   - Unity units are used to measure dimensions within the map, where 1 Unity Unit equals 1 meter.\n   - Prefabs such as **containers**, **bunkers**, and **walls** are fundamental building blocks for assembling the map's architecture ([2]).\n\n### References\n\n- [1] [World] [Tank War] Map Document.pdf\n- [2] Demo Map Design file.pdf\n- [3] [World] [Tank War] Grass Logic Design.pdf",

This tank is smaller in scale compared to other classes and is ideal for quick movements and surprise attacks.[[1](#References)]\n\n2. **Assault Tank**: This class of tank falls between the Scout and Heavy tanks in terms of size and capabilities. It is built for a balance of speed and firepower, making it versatile in various combat scenarios.[[1](#References)]\n\n3. **Heavy Tank**: Known for its high damage output, this tank class is larger and more robust, designed to be effective during large-scale engagements such as teamfights.[[1](#References)]\n\n### References\n\n- [1] [World] [Tank War] Map Document.pdf",

    "return": "## Comprehensive Overview of Tanks in Tank War\n\n### **Tank Classes and Specifications**\nThe game features three primary tank classes, each designed with distinct characteristics to cater to different combat styles. These classes include:\n\n1. **Scout**  \n   - **Size**: The smallest class of tank.\n   - **Attributes**: Characterized by its speed and agility, making it ideal for quick maneuvers and flanking strategies.  \n   - **Gameplay Notes**: Scouts utilize flank routes to gain tactical advantages during gameplay. Their small size allows them to navigate narrow paths and apply pressure from unexpected angles [1].  \n\n2. **Assault**  \n   - **Size**: Medium-sized, larger than Scout but smaller than Heavy.  \n   - **Attributes**: Offers a balance between speed and firepower, making it versatile in various combat scenarios.  \n   - **Gameplay Notes**: Assault tanks are effective in both skirmishes and teamfights, providing moderate damage output while maintaining mobility.\n\n3. **Heavy**  \n   - **Size**: The largest and most powerful tank class.  \n   - **Attributes**: Known for its durability and high damage output, the Heavy tank excels in large-scale engagements.  \n   - **Gameplay Notes**: Heavy tanks are designed to dominate teamfights, leveraging their high DPS (damage per second) to control the battlefield. Elevated positions further enhance their effectiveness due to better visibility and positioning opportunities [2].\n\n### **Tank System Details**\nThe specifications and behavior of tanks are outlined in the **Tank System Detail**, which defines the scale and capabilities of each class:\n- **Scale**: Scout < Assault < Heavy [1].\n- **Interaction Rules**:  \n  - Tanks cannot pass through each other.  \n  - Projectiles from any source cannot penetrate tanks unless specifically designed to do so.  \n  - Projectiles from opposing teams can destroy each other’s tanks.  \n\n### **Customization and Artifacts**\nTanks can be customized using the **Garage** system, which allows players to equip decorations and artifacts:\n- **Decorations**: Include wraps, decals, and stickers to modify the appearance of tanks [3].  \n- **Artifacts**: Provide special effects or buffs to enhance tank performance. These items are stored in a master data list and can be equipped through the Garage system [3].  \n\n### **Special Abilities**\nWhile no explicit special abilities are mentioned for individual tank classes, the following gameplay mechanics influence their effectiveness:\n- **Dynamic Tank Shadows**: Add realism by casting moving shadows onto the terrain, enhancing visual immersion [1].  \n- **High Ground Advantage**: Tanks positioned on elevated areas gain increased visibility and strategic positioning opportunities [2].  \n\n### **Gameplay Notes**\n- **Flank Routes**: Designed specifically for Scout tanks, these alternate paths allow players to surprise opponents and apply pressure strategically.  \n- **Combat Zones**: Areas surrounding outposts where intense battles occur. These zones provide cover, flank routes, and obstacles to enhance tactical depth [2].  \n- **Teamfights**: Large-scale engagements where all players participate, typically favoring Heavy tanks due to their high damage output. Maps designed for 5v5 play often include a central \"teamfight\" area to maximize the utility of Heavy tanks [2].  \n\n### **Technical Specifications**\n- **Measurement Unit**: Tank sizes are measured in Unity Units, where 1 meter equals 1 Unity Unit.  \n- **Smallest Measurable Entity**: Represented by DE (the smallest object in the game environment).  \n- **Assets Location**: Tank models are stored in `_GameAssets/Models/TankWars_Models/Char` [1].  \n\n### References\n\n- [1] [World] [Tank War] Map Document.pdf\n- [2] Demo Map Design file.pdf\n- [3] Design DB schema.pdf",

    "return": "### Map Information Overview\n\nThe context provides detailed information about the maps used in the game, specifically focusing on a desert-themed environment. Below is a comprehensive extraction of relevant details:\n\n#### **Map Names**\n- **Crimson Dunes**: One of the proposed names for the desert-themed map.\n- **Rust Frontier**: Another proposed name symbolizing an arid wasteland with remnants of military structures.\n- **Khamsin Outpost**: A third proposed name representing a specific area within the desert map.\n\n#### **Game Modes**\n- **Base Capture Mode**: A gameplay mode where players aim to capture enemy bases using tanks and other combat assets.\n- **Mode Outpost Breaker**: A game mode focused on destroying enemy outposts.\n- **Mode Deathmatch**: A competitive mode where players aim to eliminate opponents.\n\n#### **Scene/Environment Types**\n- **Desert Environment**: The thematic backdrop featuring arid landscapes, remnants of military bases, and post-apocalyptic elements. This environment includes:\n  - Military bunkers\n  - Radar stations\n  - Rusted containers\n  - Broken watchtowers\n  - Concrete ruins\n\n#### **Map Sizes**\n- Total map area: Approximately **50 units x 50 units** (1 Unity Unit = 1 meter).\n- Lane structure: 3 main lanes (center + 2 flanks).\n- Distance between outposts: **20–25 units**.\n\n#### **Player Counts**\n- Maps are designed for both **3v3** and **5v5** play modes:\n  - **3v3 Maps**: Emphasize lane-splitting and smaller skirmishes.\n  - **5v5 Maps**: Include a designated \"teamfight\" zone to leverage the high damage output of heavy tanks.\n\n#### **Objective Locations**\n- **Outposts**: Strategic points for territorial control, typically labeled as **A, B, and C**.\n  - Distance from base defense (DEF): **10–20 units**.\n  - Combat zones around outposts have a buffer radius of **12–15 units**, providing cover, flanking routes, and obstacles.\n- **High Ground**: Elevated areas near outposts that offer strategic advantages such as increased visibility and defensive positioning.\n\n#### **Spawn Points**\n- Spawn points are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is implied that they are positioned to ensure all tanks can reach the first outpost within **75 seconds**, avoiding feelings of being left behind.\n\n#### **Cover Elements**\n- Cover elements include:\n  - **Block Objects (BO)**: Such as buildings, containers, mountains, rocks, and signs. These objects cannot be passed through by players or projectiles.\n  - **Breakable Objects (BR)**: Including barrels, cacti, decorative items, and gates. These can be destroyed by tank projectiles.\n  - **Terrain Features**: Hills, slopes, and quicksand areas near outposts add strategic challenges.\n\n#### **Special Features**\n- **Secret Tunnels**: Hidden teleportation points connecting flank lanes with a cooldown period of **10 seconds**.\n- **Flank Routes**: Alternative paths allowing scout tanks to apply pressure by attacking from unexpected angles.\n- **Storm Events**: Dynamic weather occurrences that temporarily reduce visibility due to wind and sandstorms.\n- **Grass Logic Design**: Grass objects (HI_Grass) allow players to become invisible when inside them, adding tactical depth.\n- **Lighting & FX**: Static terrain lighting combined with dynamic tank shadows enhances realism. Red-orange lighting creates silhouettes for better tank visibility.\n\n#### **Gameplay Notes**\n- **Terrain Mechanics**:\n  - Quicksand near outposts forces teams to control the map early.\n  - Slopes and elevated areas provide opportunities for turret placement or sniping drones.\n- **Strategic Advantages**:\n  - High ground offers better visibility and positioning for tanks.\n  - Flank routes enable scouts to launch surprise attacks.\n- **Combat Dynamics**:\n  - Maps are designed with **2–3 choke points** to encourage concentrated engagements.\n  - Expected kill count per match: **30 kills total for both sides**.\n  - Combat loops last approximately **25–30 seconds**, with 20–25 small skirmishes or 8–10 large combats in a 10-minute match.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Demo Map Design file.pdf\n- [2] [World] [Tank War] Map Document.pdf",
