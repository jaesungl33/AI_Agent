      <data key="d2">Tank is a category representing the object or entity being tracked by the camera system in the game.&lt;SEP&gt;Tank is a central and multifaceted element within the context of a multiplayer gaming environment, particularly in games like *Tank War*. It serves as both an in-game vehicle and a customizable artifact that players interact with to achieve strategic objectives. Tanks are often depicted as military-style armored vehicles, rendered in 3D with high detail, featuring angular armor plating, treads, and a green and gray color scheme. These vehicles are primarily employed on desert maps, where competing factions use them to gain control over key areas by navigating and exploiting terrain mechanics. 

Tanks are integral to gameplay dynamics, offering players the ability to attack, use skills, and upgrade stats through energy orbs. They are controlled via joysticks and are associated with hitboxes, making them not only functional combat units but also customizable objects that enhance player expression. Players can decorate their Tanks with warps, decals, stickers, and other aesthetic modifications, which are displayed in virtual garages, emphasizing their visual and statistical significance.

As unlockable assets, Tanks can be acquired using in-game currency such as Coins, with varying tiers, classes, and costs influencing their availability and progression. Specific timeframes exist for unlocking meta Tanks, adding a layer of strategy to their acquisition. Key attributes of Tanks include HP (health points), Speed, Damage, Reload Time, Fire Rate, Projectile Speed, and Range, each assigned specific Design Weights to ensure balanced and competitive interactions among players. These attributes contribute to the Weighted Index, which is critical for maintaining fairness in gameplay.

In addition to their role as combat units, Tanks are also pivotal during tutorials, where players must interact with them by completing specific actions, such as destroying or trapping them, to fulfill objectives. This dual functionality—as both a playable character and a target—underscores their importance in shaping the game's economy, progression systems, and overall engagement. Whether viewed as customizable vehicles, strategic tools, or aesthetic canvases, Tanks represent the intersection of strategy, personalization, and gameplay mechanics, solidifying their position as a cornerstone of the gaming experience.&lt;SEP&gt;Tank represents the player-controlled vehicles in the game, central to combat and movement mechanics.&lt;SEP&gt;Tanks are units used in combat, with movement restricted at choke points to control their flow across the map.</data>

      <data key="d1">category</data>
      <data key="d2">An Outpost is a central strategic element in the game, particularly within the Base Capture mode. These structures serve as key locations on the map where players engage in combat to gain territorial control and manage resources. Each Outpost is designed with specific attributes such as HP (Health Points), Damage, Fire Rate, and Range, which contribute to gameplay balance and determine its effectiveness during battles. The Outpost operates as a defensive structure in Tank PvP systems, targeting and attacking enemy tanks within its range based on predefined logic, thus playing a pivotal role in tactical engagements.

Furthermore, Outposts are integral to the progression and difficulty levels of the game, featuring varying specifications that challenge players' strategies. Updates to the properties of an Outpost may occur after testing certain skills, such as the Kamikaze ability, indicating their dynamic nature within the gaming environment. Overall, Outposts enhance strategic depth by providing objectives for territorial dominance and resource management while offering balanced mechanics through their unique attributes and interactive behavior in combat scenarios.&lt;SEP&gt;Outposts are key locations on the map that can be captured by the attacking team and defended by the defending team.&lt;SEP&gt;An outpost is a key area in the map design, serving as a primary objective and focal point for combat. It often has multiple entry points and obstacles.&lt;SEP&gt;Outpost refers to a specific area or zone type within the game map, critical for strategic gameplay.</data>

      <data key="d1">category</data>
      <data key="d2">Scout is a class type within the game, primarily characterized by its high mobility and speed, which distinguishes it from other tank classes. As the smallest class of tank, the Scout is designed to utilize flank routes for tactical advantages, making it highly adaptable in combat scenarios. Its agility allows it to excel in roles that require rapid movement and quick responses, often prioritized by systems such as the Auto Focus System due to its low health and need for strategic positioning.

In addition to its mobility, the Scout is recognized for its rapid firing capabilities and DPS-focused role, benefiting significantly from boosts in DMG (damage) and FR (fire rate). This makes the Scout an essential component in gameplay, where it operates differently from classifications like the Elemental Class. Furthermore, the Scout serves as the standard Tank used as a baseline for comparing other Tanks in the Weighted Index formula, highlighting its importance in establishing performance metrics within the game.

The Scout also represents one of the tank classes in the Tank System, designed with adaptability in mind to accommodate future expansions. This forward-thinking design ensures that the Scout remains relevant as new features and mechanics are introduced. Despite some variations in descriptions—such as whether it emphasizes tactical flanking or pure damage output—all definitions converge on the core attributes of speed, agility, and strategic utility, underscoring the Scout's critical role in gameplay dynamics.&lt;SEP&gt;Scout is a player class with specific shooting logic configurations, including a BandDown value of 0.9 and a BandUp value of 0.4.&gt;&lt;SEP&gt;Scout is a tank class with the lowest coefficient (1.0), reflecting its simplicity and early-game role.&lt;SEP&gt;Scout is a class of tank in the game, characterized by lower costs compared to other classes.&lt;SEP&gt;Scout is a class in the Tank War progression system, with its own leaderboard tracking CS Season scores.</data>

      <data key="d2">Decorations are a multifaceted concept within the context of game systems and database schemas. Primarily, Decorations refer to items used for tank customization, including wraps, decals, and stickers. These customization items enhance or modify the appearance of artifacts like tanks, offering players the ability to personalize their gaming experience. Attributes associated with Decorations include type, name, description, preview URL, price in gold and diamonds, rarity, and creation timestamp, all of which contribute to their role in the game's customization system.

In another context, Decorations are small map elements that players can pass through without significant interaction. These elements do not affect gameplay mechanics substantially but may contribute to the visual or thematic design of the game environment. Additionally, Decorations are core elements within the game systems that could be linked or explained by discarded content, suggesting their relevance in both current and deprecated features of the game.

From a database perspective, Decorations are also a structured data entity, represented as a table within the game's database schema. This table can be related to other tables, such as the Purchases table, via the Item Id field. The dual nature of Decorations—as both tangible in-game items and abstract database entries—highlights their integral role in both the functional and structural aspects of the game system. Despite some contextual overlap, these descriptions collectively emphasize the importance of Decorations in enhancing user experience and maintaining organized data architecture.&lt;SEP&gt;Decorations are items that players can purchase and apply to customize their tanks in the Garage system of Tank War.&lt;SEP&gt;Decorations include items like wraps, decals, and stickers that players can apply to customize their tanks.</data>

Within the context of the game's database schema, Players represent a structured data entity stored as a table. This table contains attributes associated with each player, including their name, level, gold, diamonds, achievements, and other relevant information. The Players table is also linked to other tables, such as Purchases, through the Player Id field, enabling relational data management.

In gameplay, Players interact with the digital interface to customize virtual tanks and collaborate within the game environment. They can participate in various activities, such as purchasing items, completing quests, and engaging in competitive modes like the Game Mode Module Tank War Deathmatch. These interactions highlight the central role of Players in driving engagement and progression within the game system.

      <data key="d2">Tanks are customizable vehicles central to the gameplay mechanics of Tank War, a game system where they serve as primary entities for players. They are characterized by attributes such as speed, damage, fire rate, and notably higher HP values compared to smaller objects within the game. Tanks can be personalized and upgraded through various means, including decorations, artifacts, and modifications, allowing players to tailor their vehicles to specific strategies or preferences. These customizations are integral to both the visual and functional aspects of Tanks, enhancing their role in gameplay.

Within the context of the game's database schema, Tanks represent a structured data entity that is integral to the system’s design. They are potentially associated with other components like decorations, customization items, and discarded content, indicating their importance not only in gameplay but also in the underlying data architecture. Furthermore, Tanks are visually represented on the map by distinct icons and rendered in unique colors to differentiate between players or teams, emphasizing their centrality to competitive modes such as Tank War Deathmatch.

While Tanks primarily function as vehicles in Tank War, they also appear to have broader applications depending on the context. For instance, they may be categorized by type and ownership status, suggesting variability in how they are deployed or utilized across different scenarios. Despite some descriptions focusing on their technical representation in databases or their visual depiction on maps, all accounts consistently highlight their significance as customizable and strategic elements within the game environment.</data>

      <data key="d1">artifact</data>
      <data key="d2">Artifacts are significant items within the game system, often providing benefits or buffs to players, particularly in relation to tanks. These objects may hold importance within the game's customization, progression systems, or quest-related activities, contributing to both gameplay mechanics and player experience. They represent a core element of the game’s structured data entities and have been noted for their potential connection to discarded content, possibly indicating an intended role that was never fully realized.

From a technical perspective, Artifacts also refer to a database table within the game's schema, functioning as a critical component in organizing and managing game data. This table is linked to other tables such as Purchases through fields like Item Id, ensuring proper relational integrity within the system. Furthermore, Artifacts are explicitly mentioned in discussions of the game’s master data lists and database design, underscoring their importance not only in gameplay but also in backend operations.

Despite some descriptions focusing on gameplay features and others emphasizing technical aspects, all accounts agree on the central significance of Artifacts within the game ecosystem. While certain details about their exact role—whether tied to customization, progression, or discarded content—remain somewhat ambiguous, they consistently emerge as vital elements in both player-facing and developmental contexts.&lt;SEP&gt;Artifacts are items in Tank War that players can interact with in the garage.&lt;SEP&gt;Artifacts refer to items or components associated with tanks, displayed in the player's current list of equipped artifacts.</data>

      <data key="d2">The Combat Module is a critical system or component within the Tank War game, designed to manage and enhance combat-related functionalities. It plays a significant role in the design and execution of combat mechanics, particularly in scenarios involving tank battles. The module is integral to the Base Capture Mode, where it provides additional context for tank capabilities and outpost functionality. By organizing and regulating skill behaviors, the Combat Module ensures that players experience dynamic and engaging gameplay, balancing strategic depth with operational clarity.

Within the context of Tank War, the Combat Module serves as a unifying element in the game's combat system. It is responsible for handling skill controls in mobile games, managing interactions and abilities of tanks during gameplay. This includes shooting logic, which involves configurable parameters such as Speed, Range, and Radius for bullet behavior. The module’s role extends to interactions with projectiles and environmental objects, further enriching the player’s experience by adding layers of complexity and realism to combat scenarios.

While descriptions of the Combat Module vary in focus, they consistently highlight its importance in enhancing gameplay mechanics. Some emphasize its role in Base Capture Mode and outpost design, while others concentrate on its management of combat mechanics and shooting logic. Despite these differing contexts, the Combat Module remains a central component in the design and functionality of Tank War, streamlining player interaction with combat systems and ensuring an immersive gaming experience.&lt;SEP&gt;Combat Module refers to the system governing in-match tank upgrades and combat mechanics in Tank War.</data>

      <data key="d2">Tank War is an overarching game or system centered around tank-based combat, offering players an immersive experience that integrates strategy, customization, and interactive gameplay. It functions both as a specific match type within a broader multiplayer framework and as the central project under which various modules, such as the Combat Module and Outpost Design, are developed. At its core, Tank War features a robust Tank System with diverse tank classes and mechanics, ensuring a balanced and engaging gameplay environment. The game includes competitive multiplayer modes such as Deathmatch, Base Capture, and Outpost Breaker, often involving strategic battles between teams using tanks with specific objectives.

A key aspect of Tank War is its Garage system, which allows players to manage, customize, and interact with tanks and artifacts. This system enhances strategic depth by enabling modifications to tank appearances and configurations, providing players with tools for personalization. The in-game graphical user interface (GUI) further streamlines interactions through joysticks, skill buttons, mission bars, and other elements designed for optimal usability. Key screens like the Garage Screen, reward screen, and results screen ensure smooth user interaction and provide clear feedback on gameplay outcomes.

Tank War incorporates an economic and monetization system aimed at enhancing player engagement through free and paid tracks. The game's economy involves currency flow, reward systems, and premium content distributed at specific frequencies, managing in-game financial structures such as gold generation and expenditure. Monetization strategies are particularly tailored for the Latin American (LATAM) market, featuring localized Battle Passes, personalized skins, and culturally relevant events. Additionally, Tank War implements an Elo and Rank system to organize player progression and enhance competitive engagement, underscoring its focus on creating a structured yet versatile gaming experience.

Tank War also includes various achievements, challenges, and a leaderboard system designed to rank players based on their performance. It is a gaming event or competition where participants engage in competitive tank battles across different gameplay styles. Furthermore, Tank War is the system in which the Fusion mechanic is implemented, providing a gacha-like experience that adds another layer of excitement and engagement for players. Overall, Tank War offers a comprehensive and dynamic gaming experience that combines strategic gameplay, customization, competitive ranking, and economic incentives to create a rich and engaging environment for its players.</data>

      <data key="d1">category</data>
      <data key="d2">Assault is a tank class within the Tank System, designed to offer a balanced combination of speed, firepower, and utility in gameplay. It serves as an all-rounder archetype, representing a middle ground between specialized classes such as the Elemental Class and others that focus on specific attributes like high damage output or defensive capabilities. The Assault class is characterized by its adaptability, making it suitable for dynamic and mid-game scenarios where players require both offensive and defensive proficiency.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, Assault is a DPS-focused role supported by DMG (damage) and FR (fire rate) scaling, allowing it to pose a significant threat to opponents while maintaining balanced performance. The class features specific shooting logic configurations, including a BandDown value of 0.8, though its BandUp value remains undefined. Additionally, Assault has a coefficient of 1.2, indicating moderate complexity and utility, which positions it between simpler and more resource-intensive classes like Scout and Heavy in terms of cost and strategic depth.

Overall, Assault is intended to provide players with a versatile and engaging playstyle, offering moderate costs and balanced attributes that cater to a wide range of combat situations. Its design emphasizes adaptability and effectiveness, ensuring it remains a valuable choice for players seeking a harmonious blend of speed, firepower, and tactical flexibility.&lt;SEP&gt;Assault is a class in the Tank War progression system, with its own leaderboard tracking CS Season scores.</data>

      <data key="d1">category</data>
      <data key="d2">Heavy is a prominent tank class in the Tank System, recognized as the largest and most powerful type within the game. It is characterized by its exceptional durability, high damage output, and suitability for frontline control. The Heavy class is often described as a bruiser-type gameplay archetype, emphasizing raw power and resilience over tactical finesse, which contrasts it with other classes like the Elemental Class. Its role prioritizes high HP to ensure survivability, making it a critical asset in gameplay scenarios where durability is essential.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, Heavy tanks are optimized for late-game strength and increased complexity, supported by specific shooting logic configurations such as a BandDown value of 0.7, though the BandUp value remains undefined. This class is also associated with a coefficient of 1.3, reflecting its enhanced capabilities compared to other tank types. Due to its strategic importance and resource demands, Heavy is considered the most expensive tank class, highlighting its value in high-stakes gameplay situations.

Heavy tanks are typically targeted when they are closer to the player or when no other priority targets are available, underscoring their role as durable adversaries or allies. Overall, Heavy stands out as a class designed for players seeking a robust and impactful presence on the battlefield, blending power, endurance, and strategic depth into a single, formidable entity.&lt;SEP&gt;Heavy is a class in the Tank War progression system, with its own leaderboard tracking CS Season scores.</data>

      <data key="d2">Discarded Content refers to various empty or undefined elements found within a document related to database schema design and game system components. These elements appear as small, empty text fragments or placeholders scattered across multiple pages, often specified by bounding box coordinates and page indices. On page 1, Discarded Content is described as an empty section located between discussions of 'Logic sort danh sách tank' and 'Thông tin tank,' likely intended for additional details or annotations. Similarly, on page 2, it manifests as a minimal placeholder ('??') within the bounding box [50, 715, 79, 740], representing an unresolved or omitted element in the document structure. Another instance on the same page is a small, empty text fragment within the bounding box [48, 464, 79, 489], potentially serving as a visual element or placeholder.

On page 3, Discarded Content appears as a small, empty text block with bounding box dimensions [50, 190, 80, 213], likely intended for a label, identifier, or minor annotation. In some cases, Discarded Content also represents metadata about the document's current state and future revisions. For example, it may include a note indicating that certain components, specifically those highlighted in gray, will be added later. This suggests that Discarded Content not only serves as a placeholder for missing or future content but also provides insight into the document's development process.

Overall, Discarded Content encompasses a range of empty or non-textual elements within the document, functioning as placeholders, unresolved annotations, or metadata indicators. These elements are integral to understanding the document's structure and the intentions of its creators, even though they remain undefined or incomplete at the time of documentation.&lt;SEP&gt;The discarded content refers to an incomplete bullet point labeled 'Kỹ năng' (translated as 'Skills'), appearing on Page 2 within the bounding box [90, 30, 675, 61].&lt;SEP&gt;Discarded Content refers to a section header labeled '7.3 Blocker Category (cho Level/Art/Dev cấu hình)' that was intended to detail the configuration of blocker categories for level designers, artists, and developers.&lt;SEP&gt;Discarded Content is a small, empty fragment located on page 1 of the document, situated between sections discussing gold generation mechanics and upgrade costs in a game mode module for 'Tank War.'&lt;SEP&gt;Discarded Content refers to the section header '6.

      <data key="d1">category</data>
      <data key="d2">Gameplay Mechanics encompass the rules, systems, and interactions that define how a game operates, ensuring fairness, balance, and engagement. These mechanics govern various elements within the game, including the interactions between outposts, tanks, and projectiles, as well as the strategic roles of different entities such as the Elemental class. In specific contexts like the Tank War game system or the Base Capture gamemode, Gameplay Mechanics are influenced by metrics such as HP, Damage, Fire Rate, Projectile Speed, and Range, which are carefully balanced to enhance the overall gaming experience.

Within certain games, Gameplay Mechanics also involve enhancements to tank attributes, such as damage range and balance, which are aimed at improving both functionality and player satisfaction. The design philosophy behind these mechanics often emphasizes creating an accessible yet competitive environment, particularly in modes centered around tank battles or strategic objectives like capturing bases. Additionally, the mechanics may relate to specific functionalities or skills associated with tanks, further enriching the depth and complexity of gameplay.

In cases where Gameplay Mechanics are applied to distinct game modes or classes, they reflect the unique strategic considerations and roles within those contexts. For example, the Elemental class may have its own set of mechanics designed to highlight its unique abilities and contributions to gameplay. Despite variations across different modes or classes, the overarching goal of Gameplay Mechanics remains consistent: to create a predictable, engaging, and enjoyable experience for players by structuring interactions and systems in a coherent and balanced manner.&lt;SEP&gt;Gameplay mechanics include scores, time durations, or success rates, which are likely represented in the table's structure.&lt;SEP&gt;Gameplay Mechanics refers to the rules and systems governing player interactions, including tank movement, combat, and strategy.</data>

      <data key="d1">concept</data>
      <data key="d2">HP, or Health Points, is a critical attribute in various contexts, particularly within systems involving tanks and other entities. In the realm of tank systems, HP represents the health points of a tank, contributing significantly to its effectiveness and durability. The Design Weight of HP is noted to be 1.2, indicating its importance in balancing the tank’s overall performance. Additionally, HP plays a substantial role in the calculation of the Weighted Index, where it has a high Multiplier and Weight value, especially for the Assault Tank, further emphasizing its contribution to the tank's combat effectiveness.

In the game context of Tank War, HP refers to the health points of various entities such as tanks, outposts, and other objects. This attribute not only determines the maximum health of these entities but also influences their survivability and strategic importance within the game environment. For instance, HP shows variability in upgrades, with descriptions mentioning different total increases—ranging from a cumulative total increase of 12.50% to compounded increases of 21.30%, and even a highest total increase of 29.40%. These variations highlight HP's adaptability and significance in enhancing a tank’s role-specific capabilities, particularly in terms of survivability.

Furthermore, HP extends beyond just tanks, as it also represents the health attribute of other classes, such as the Elemental class, where it is described as average. Despite some contextual differences, HP consistently reflects the core concept of health and durability across multiple systems, ensuring that entities can withstand damage and fulfill their roles effectively.

Decals are often described as sticker-like items that can be applied to specific parts of the tank, including the body, turret, or tracks, allowing for detailed personalization.

In addition to being a functional customization option, decals serve as cosmetic items that can be earned through gameplay. They are available in both regular and premium forms, with variations like Decal (gacha thuong) offered in the Free track and Decal Premium in the Paid track of the Battle Pass system. These decals provide players with the ability to add unique designs or patterns to their tanks, enhancing their aesthetic appeal without affecting performance.

While decals are primarily known for their decorative purposes, they come with specific placement rules, ensuring that their application adheres to predefined guidelines within the game or system. Overall, Decal represents an essential category of customization that balances visual enhancement with structured application, offering users both creativity and consistency in tank design.&lt;SEP&gt;Decal is an item that can be layered on top of Warp. It is stored in the inventory and can be reused, but only applied to specific attachment points on the tank.</data>

      <data key="d1">artifact</data>
      <data key="d2">The Image Path refers to the file location of an image used in various analytical and design contexts, particularly within the game Tank War. It serves as a critical reference point for developers and designers working on visual assets tied to the game's interface and systems. The paths direct to images associated with specific components of the game, such as the main screen, tank customization UI, reward screens, and the Tank War Garage Design. These images are stored locally in structured directories and are integral to iterative design and analysis processes. For example, one path points to "/Users/madeinheaven/Documents/GitHub/AI_Agent/output/character_module_tank_war_garage_design_-_main/[Character Module] [Tank War] Garage Design - Main/auto/images/39653e967e86cb900a9c1d5b7ccc51dddce51dd4c5476cf25ba9aac8bb92e285.jpg," while another directs to a similar but distinct file location.

In addition to its role in UI design, the Image Path is also associated with the analysis of various game systems. It represents the location of images related to tables or visual representations used in examining specific modules, such as the Capture Base mode, the Tank Cost System, and the gaming economy system. While some descriptions focus on the visual representation of tables or specific game modes, others highlight the importance of the Image Path in referencing images for broader system analyses. Despite slight variations in context, all descriptions converge on the central theme of using the Image Path to locate and analyze visual assets critical to both the game’s design and functionality.&lt;SEP&gt;The image path refers to the location of the file associated with the post-match profile document.&lt;SEP&gt;The image path refers to the location of the infographic detailing the leaderboard system for Tank War.</data>

      <data key="d2">Phienban refers to the version number of a document, serving as a critical identifier for tracking iterative updates and modifications throughout the design and development process. It is commonly used across various types of design documents, including the Garage Design document, Reward Screen Design document, Tank Selection Screen Design document, Outpost Design document, and documents related to the Monetization Module. Specific examples of Phienban include versions such as v1.0, v1.1, and up to v1.5, each denoting distinct stages in the lifecycle of a document. By marking incremental changes, Phienban enables effective management and organization of revisions, ensuring that progress and modifications are systematically recorded.

In some contexts, Phienban also extends beyond design documents to represent the versioning of broader entities, such as game modes. In these cases, it indicates different stages of development within the game mode's lifecycle, reflecting iterative updates similar to those in document versioning. Additionally, Phienban may appear as a column in tables, specifically designed to track iterations of documents or modules like the Monetization Module. This highlights its versatility as a tool for version control across various domains and formats.

Overall, Phienban plays an essential role in maintaining clarity and structure during collaborative projects by providing a clear record of changes and developments. Whether applied to design documents, game modes, or other project components, it ensures that all stakeholders can easily identify and reference specific iterations, fostering efficient workflows and reducing ambiguity.&lt;SEP&gt;Phienban refers to the versioning system used to track updates in the design document.</data>

      <data key="d2">Ngay is a term consistently used to denote the date associated with version updates across various design documents and game modes. It plays a critical role in tracking the timeline of changes, ensuring proper version control, and maintaining documentation history. Ngay specifies the exact date when a particular version of a document or game mode was created, updated, or finalized. This applies to a wide range of design documents, including but not limited to the Garage Design, Reward Screen Design, Tank Selection Screen Design, and Outpost Design documents. In all these contexts, Ngay serves as a timestamp that marks the lifecycle of each version within the respective documents.

In some descriptions, Ngay is specifically highlighted as representing the date column in tables that log document versions, such as "17-11-2025" for version v1.0. This further underscores its function as a tool for precise record-keeping. While the types of documents or game modes may vary, the fundamental role of Ngay remains constant: to indicate the date tied to the creation, modification, or completion of each version. Its application ensures clarity and accountability in tracking iterative changes, whether in design files or game mode updates. Across all descriptions, there is no conflicting information about Ngay's purpose, affirming its consistent and unified role in version management.&lt;SEP&gt;Ngay represents the date associated with each version update in the version control log.&lt;SEP&gt;Ngay represents the date associated with each version update in the Tank War - ELO &amp; RANK System design document.</data>

      <data key="d2">Version V1.0 refers to multiple iterations of documents or systems across different projects, each with distinct contexts and creation details. In one instance, Version V1.0 is the initial version of the Garage Design document, finalized on 26-09-2025, with the description "Hoan thanh file" (Completed file). Another description identifies Version V1.0 as the initial version of a document created on 06-08-2025, labeled "Taofile." Similarly, Version V1.0 of the Auto Focus system was created by Kent on 18-08-2025, also marked as "Taofile," signifying its status as the first release.

In other contexts, Version V1.0 marks the initial creation of a file by Kent on 29-06-2025, though no specific project is mentioned in this case. Another reference describes Version V1.0 as the initial version of a document dated 16-09-2025, associated with both general documentation and the completion of the Deathmatch game mode design document. Additionally, Version V1.0 is noted as the first version of a document created on 21-08-2025, again described as "Hoan thanh file." Lastly, Version V1.0 is linked to the Monetization Localization (LATAM) project, representing a specific iteration of a document dated 03-11-2025.

While the descriptions collectively emphasize Version V1.0 as an initial or completed milestone across various projects, the lack of consistent dates and contexts indicates that these references pertain to distinct entities or documents sharing the same version label.

      <data key="d0">Table</data>
      <data key="d1">artifact</data>
      <data key="d2">The Table is a versatile and structured tool utilized across various contexts, primarily for organizing, presenting, and managing complex information. Within the context of the 'Tank War' game, the Table serves multiple purposes, including structuring data for components and features, tracking metadata for design documents, and supporting discussions through color-coded statuses. It maps relationships between elements such as UI components, player interaction scenarios, and system responses, often appearing in two-column or three-column formats. The Table outlines specific attributes like HP, SPD, DMG, and FR, detailing percentage increases across upgrade levels and providing cumulative totals, which clarifies interactions within the game’s design.

In addition to its role in 'Tank War,' the Table is also employed in other projects and systems. For instance, it organizes metadata about document versions, dates, descriptions, authors, reviewers, and approval statuses for projects like the Garage System and Monetization Localization (LATAM). In the LATAM project, the Table provides a structured breakdown of monthly events, their types, and expected revenue spikes. Similarly, it organizes information about game modes and their match settings, including parameters like match duration and player count, and contains data related to key user-related metrics in ranked games, focusing on 'Coins' and 'Exp (Trophy Road).' 

The Table also supports structured overviews of in-game items, costs, and configurations, offering insights into VFX/Animation, Map Layout, and class-specific shooting logic in combat modules. It defines parameters for tank war matches and provides detailed breakdowns of upgrade costs for four in-game stats across ten levels. Despite some variations in structure depending on its application, the Table consistently demonstrates its utility as a multifunctional artifact. Whether tracking document versions, mapping UI components, or representing system behaviors, the Table stands out as an indispensable tool for structuring, analyzing, and managing intricate information across different projects and systems.&lt;SEP&gt;The table is a structured representation of data that provides details about the ranking system in a competitive gaming context.</data>

      <data key="d2">Base Capture is a distinctive game mode featured in Tank War, specifically highlighted in the World Tank War event. In this competitive gameplay mode, players aim to capture strategic points or bases, aligning with the broader objective of taking over enemy bases. The mode incorporates an in-match upgrade system akin to Deathmatch, adding a layer of strategic depth to the gameplay. Base Capture is meticulously designed with configurable match parameters, ensuring a balanced and engaging experience. Notably, it employs selective enabling of 'UseMultiHeightSweep' and limits 'UsePitchAssist' to ≤2° to avoid over-assistance issues. Each match in Base Capture has a default duration of 15 minutes and supports a fixed player count of 10. As one of the gameplay profiles analyzed, Base Capture contributes significantly to the overall design of match profiles within the game.</data>

      <data key="d1">concept</data>
      <data key="d2">The Game Mode Module refers to a system or framework used to design and implement different game modes within a game, specifically in the context of Tank War and Project TOG. It serves as a structural framework that defines the rules, mechanics, and overall gameplay experience for various modes, such as Deathmatch. The module is integral to creating a cohesive and engaging player experience by establishing the parameters within which the game operates.

The Game Mode Module is not limited to just defining basic rules but also incorporates advanced features such as random events, terrain dynamics, and economic adjustments, particularly in the context of tank warfare deathmatch scenarios. This scalability allows developers to introduce complexity and variety into the gameplay, enhancing replayability and strategic depth. By integrating these elements, the module ensures that each game mode offers unique challenges and opportunities for players.

In summary, the Game Mode Module represents a specific and essential component within a game's architecture, governing how different modes of play are structured and executed. Whether applied to Tank War or Project TOG, it plays a critical role in shaping the player’s experience by providing a clear and dynamic framework for gameplay mechanics and rules.&lt;SEP&gt;Game Mode Module refers to the structural framework within which the Outpost Breaker game mode was developed and iterated.</data>

    <node id="Deathmatch">
      <data key="d0">Deathmatch</data>
      <data key="d1">concept</data>
      <data key="d2">Deathmatch is a competitive game mode primarily characterized by player-versus-player (PvP) combat, where participants aim to achieve the highest score or number of kills within a limited time frame. Typically, players compete individually, striving to eliminate opponents and secure the top position. This mode often supports variable match durations, ranging from 5 to 10 minutes, and accommodates between 4 to 8 players. In some contexts, Deathmatch is associated with specific modules, such as the Tank War module, emphasizing solo competition and total kills.

In addition to its core mechanics, Deathmatch offers different configurations for match settings, making it adaptable to various gameplay profiles. It is also noted for its role in iterative development processes, highlighting its significance in refining game design. While the mode generally provides standard XP rewards (ModeMultiplier = 1.0), losing matches may result in lower XP gains, encouraging quick player engagement. Despite variations in descriptions, Deathmatch consistently emphasizes fast-paced, high-stakes gameplay focused on defeating opponents to achieve the highest score.</data>

      <data key="d2">The Monetization Module refers to a system or framework designed to manage and optimize revenue generation within gaming economies, particularly in the context of the Tank War game. It serves as a critical component of the game's Economy &amp; Monetization System, focusing on strategies to generate revenue through various means such as in-game customization items, reward structures, and player engagement techniques. The module outlines the structure for generating income by leveraging player progression systems and offering opportunities for players to invest in their gaming experience.

A key aspect of the Monetization Module is its adaptability to specific regional markets, with particular attention given to culturally resonant strategies. For instance, it has been specifically tailored for the LATAM region, ensuring that monetization approaches align with local preferences and trends. This regional focus underscores the module’s flexibility and its ability to cater to diverse player bases while maintaining an optimized revenue stream.

While the descriptions emphasize the module’s role in managing in-game economies and enhancing player engagement, some variations exist regarding its exact scope and application. However, these differences likely reflect the multifaceted nature of the Monetization Module rather than conflicting definitions. Overall, the Monetization Module is integral to sustaining the economic framework of Tank War, balancing revenue generation with player satisfaction and cultural relevance.</data>

      <data key="d2">Coin is a soft currency utilized within the game Tank War, functioning as an integral part of the in-game economy. It is primarily earned through regular gameplay and is rewarded consistently via the Free Track of the Battle Pass system, with additional opportunities for earning it 3-5 times daily. These periodic rewards are estimated to approximate half the value of a winning match's reward. Coin can also be obtained through both the Free and Paid Tracks of the Battle Pass system, ensuring widespread accessibility among players. Within the game, Coin serves multiple purposes, including purchasing essential and accessible items such as tanks and participating in Normal Warp activities. Additionally, it plays a role in the Artifact Enhancement System, where each enhancement incurs a fixed cost of 1,000 Coins. The availability and utility of Coin support a free-to-play (F2P) friendly design, allowing players to engage fully with various in-game features without significant barriers.</data>

      <data key="d2">Battle Pass is a seasonal progression system in Tank War, serving as both a gameplay feature and a monetization mechanism. It operates on a cyclical basis, typically lasting 6-8 weeks per season, and offers players the opportunity to earn rewards by completing challenges or progressing through tiers. The system includes both free and paid tracks, providing access to a variety of rewards such as cosmetic items, exclusive content, and themed tasks designed to enhance user engagement and retention.

The rewards within the Battle Pass system often include cosmetic items like warps, decals, exclusive skins, and event badges. These incentives are structured to encourage continued gameplay and progression. Additionally, the system incorporates social media tasks and other activities to further integrate player interaction. A notable adaptation of the Battle Pass is the 'Regional Pass,' which introduces culturally relevant themes, particularly for LATAM audiences, showcasing its flexibility and role in broadening the game's appeal.

As part of the Economy &amp; Monetization System in Tank War, the Battle Pass represents a core mechanic for driving revenue while maintaining player interest. By combining progression-based rewards with exclusive content, it strikes a balance between enhancing the gaming experience and serving as an effective monetization strategy. Despite variations in its implementation, the overarching purpose of the Battle Pass remains consistent: to incentivize gameplay and reward players for their dedication and progression within the game.</data>
